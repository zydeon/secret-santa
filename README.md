python3 main.py <credentials.txt> <santas_file.csv>

Examples of how each input file should be formatted are in `data`.

Feel free to use `data` for storing personal configurations, or other things not related to this repo, since these files will be gitignored.



## TODO
* Add SMTP server to credentials file
* Add Subject and Body templates to an external file as well
